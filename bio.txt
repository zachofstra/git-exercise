I am 38 year old family man and Soldier at 20 years of service. I have been married for almost 17 years and I have 2 children aged\
15 and 14. I enjoy my job, don't enjoy coding, but love complexity science. I will retire in the next 2 years and I \
will need a new job that I hope my unusual Masters in Complexity Science will help me achieve.
