I was born in the state of Michigan and enlisted in the Army in 2005. I am 38 year old family man and Soldier at 20 years of service. I have been married for almost 17 years and I have 2 children aged\
15 and 14. I enjoy my job, don't enjoy coding, but love complexity science. I will retire in the next 2 years and I \
will need a new job that I hope my unusual Masters in Complexity Science will help me achieve. I completed high 
school at South Christian High School in 2004, graduated with my Associate's Degree in Middle Eastern Studies
from Defense Language Institure in 2006, and received my Bachelor's from Arizona State University in 2024.
