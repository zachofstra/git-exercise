Whitetail deer hunting is a modern sport with ancient history. My first deer was a buck I shot with my bow after 4 years of 
hunting. I have thorougly enjoyed being in green space for a majority of the fall and the thrill that hunting gives 
me. Additionally, I have been taught and learned a few more things on my own on butchering and processing all my
own deer. We don't generally eat any beef in our family outside of steaks at a restaurant on occasion. Almost all
of our red meat is venison that only I have ever touched. I enjoy providing for my family as well as the 
relaxation of being able to "do nothing" in the woods without guilt because I am in fact doing "something." I am
hunting and I will do so until I am no longer physically able.

Hunting season across the United States for whitetail deer is always in the autumn. My state's season opens in 
September and runs through December. I usually devote about 20 hours per week to hunting during this timeframe
depending on the weather. I also always take the week that includes November 15th off to go to Michigan for
a family deer camp that we have there annually at the family cabin.
