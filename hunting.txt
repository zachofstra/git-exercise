Deer hunting is a modern sport with ancient history. My first deer was a buck I shot with my bow after 4 years of 
hunting. I have thorougly enjoyed being in green space for a majority of the fall and the thrill that hunting gives 
me. Additionally, I have been taught and learned a few more things on my own on butchering and processing all my
own deer. We don't generally eat any beef in our family outside of steaks at a restaurant on occasion. Almost all
of our red meat is venison that only I have ever touched. I enjoy providing for my family as well as the 
relaxation of being able to "do nothing" in the woods without guilt because I am in fact doing "something." I am
hunting and I will do so until I am no longer physically able.
